Small Python Project to cleanly load notes and other documents in a digital and editable format.

There are already many good free options for this!
But since i am still in the early phase of learning to Develop anything really, i wanted to do a Project which i thought was really cool.

My goal is to create a small App where i can load an Image of either handwritten or typed notes/documents and get an editable Text out of it.

Current Status:
Using Tesseract-OCR for the typed Docs, currently trying to get image optimization integrated so tesseract can be as accurate as possible.
The handwriting part hasn't started yet.
